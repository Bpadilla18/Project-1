  <h1>A follower Of Christ</h1>
  <p>Since I was born, people throughout my life have told me to follow God. To this day I've been on the same path following my Christian beliefs. As I grow older, I begin to think of the difficult questions of life. When I think like this, I go to the Bible.<p>
  <p>I usually read the King James Bible. This version is more reliable to historic sayings than the other Bibles out today.</p>
